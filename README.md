# labecommerce-backend

This is a mockup of a little grocery store's database structured using Typescript, SQLite3 and Knex, developed as a back-end project at Labenu's full stack bootcamp!

You may find: user, products, purchases tables and a products-purchases relational one.
There are creating, reading, updating and deleting queries for each table.
The reading, updating and deletings queries uses 'id' as selecting factor, but product's also include a search by name like query.
The creating and updating queries requires the filling of a body so the information inserted may be used for creation.

It's a quite simple, yet functional, I hope you have a good time seeing how it works and if there are any doubts, just ask! :)
